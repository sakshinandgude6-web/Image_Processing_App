# Image Processing Service (Cloudinary-Like Application)

A full-stack cloud image processing platform that allows users to:
Register & Login (JWT Authentication)
Upload images to AWS S3
Apply image transformations (resize, grayscale, format conversion)
Cache transformed images
Retrieve original and transformed images
Manage images via a modern React dashboard

## Live Deployment

Frontend (Vercel): https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
Backend (Railway): https://your-backend-url.railway.app

 ## Tech Stack
Frontend

React (Vite)

React Router (BrowserRouter)

Axios

CSS (Custom Styling)

Vercel Deployment

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB (Mongoose)

JWT Authentication

AWS S3 (Cloud Storage)

Sharp (Image Processing)

Railway Deployment

## Authentication System
Backend

JWT token generation

Auth middleware for protected routes

Secure user-password hashing

Owner-based image access control

Frontend

Login & Register pages

Token stored in localStorage

Axios interceptor for attaching JWT

Protected route logic

Logout clears token & redirects to login

## Image Management Features
1️. Upload Image

Upload via multipart/form-data

Store original image in AWS S3

Save metadata in MongoDB:

Width

Height

Format

Size

Owner

2️. Transform Image

Supported transformations:

Resize

Grayscale

Format conversion (JPEG/PNG)

Transformation Process:

Fetch original image from S3

Apply transformations using Sharp

Generate unique hash

Check cache (TransformedImage collection)

If cached → return existing image

If not cached → store new transformed image in S3

3️. List Images (Paginated)
GET /images?page=1&limit=10

Returns:

Page number

Total images

Results array

4️. Get Image by ID

Returns:

Original image

Latest transformed image (if exists)

## Frontend Features
Pages Implemented
Login Page

User authentication

Redirect to dashboard after login

Register Page

New user creation

JWT returned after registration

Dashboard

Displays all user images

Paginated API integration

Click to view image details

Upload Page

Image file input

Preview before upload

Upload success confirmation

Image Details Page

Display original image

Apply transformations

View transformed result

Cache-aware transformation handling

## SPA Routing Issue (Important Learning)

Since the app uses:

<BrowserRouter>

Refreshing or directly accessing routes like:
/login
/dashboard
caused 404 errors on Vercel.

Solution found:

React Router handles routes client-side, but Vercel tries to find physical files.

Added vercel.json:

{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}

All routes serve index.html

React Router handles navigation

No more 404 errors

## Environment Variables
Backend (.env)
PORT=5000
